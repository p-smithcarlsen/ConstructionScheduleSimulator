# ConstructionScheduleSimulator:
Our thesis project: A program that can simulate a construction project schedule.

# Description:

# User guide:

## Use case 1:
Use case 2 is to run an experiment, simulating a number of construction projects.

  1) navigate to the root of the project to begin
  2) compile the project by running 'javac program.java'
  3) run the program by running 'java program.java <param1> <param2>'
      where param1 determines the type (schedule)
      where param2 determines manual input (true/false)
      for example: java program.java schedule true

## Use case 2:
Use case 1 is to simulate a single construction project as a project manager.

If you 

  1) navigate to the root of the project to begin
  2) compile the project by running 'javac program.java'
  3) run the program by running 'java program.java experiment <param1> <param2>'
      where param1 determines the type (experiment)
      where param2 determines number of projects (1...n)
      for example: java program.java experiment 1000
